Hello, my name is Ramdhei LÃ³pez Arcila, I'm a Colombian Platzi Student
eager to learn web development. I'm 17 years old.

I'm also studying Systems Engineering at Caldas University in Colombia, but I don't like it a lot

I love technology too, not just use or consume it, I like to create, that's why I'm learning web development

I love Imagine Dragons

Queen is for Master branch
